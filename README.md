# Patient-Follow-Up
This **web-based Patient Follow-Up System** is designed to streamline post-discharge care, ensuring seamless communication between healthcare providers and patients. The application empowers healthcare teams to monitor recovery, promote treatment adherence, and provide proactive support for improved health outcomes.  

Key features include a **patient portal** that allows users to access personalized health updates, medication schedules, and follow-up instructions. Patients can easily communicate with healthcare providers, ensuring timely resolution of concerns. On the other hand, the **provider dashboard** offers a centralized platform for tracking patient progress, managing follow-ups, and accessing medical records.  

The system integrates **appointment scheduling**, enabling patients to book follow-up visits effortlessly, while providers can manage their schedules more efficiently. **Automated notifications and reminders** are sent to patients for upcoming appointments, medication timings, or any critical health checks, fostering better compliance with prescribed care plans.  

Developed using modern web technologies, this responsive application simplifies the follow-up process, making it accessible across devices. By bridging the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers, the system ensures a more proactive approach to recovery and enhances overall healthcare quality. This project highlights expertise in web development and a commitment to leveraging technology for impactful healthcare solutions.
